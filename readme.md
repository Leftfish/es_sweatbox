### todo:
* customizable arrivals (at least intervals based on the AD capacity, number per wave)
* fill in missing flight data for WA33, WA11
* remove hard-coded squawks, get them generated instead
* add generation of departures too: get script to generate 10 coords for EPWA, 3 for EPLL, 3 for EPMO
* customizable departures (directions?)
* prepare ~30 more arrivals and ~20 departures from real life data
* add EPKK/EPKT support
